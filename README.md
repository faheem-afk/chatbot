TalentScout Interview Bot

This is a fun little AI-based Interview Bot built using Streamlit + OpenAI GPT-4o. It asks up to 5 technical questions to a candidate based on their tech stack or preferred role, and logs everything into Google Cloud Storage.

‚∏ª

What it Does?
	1.	Gathers candidate‚Äôs basic details using a simple form.
	2.	Starts a chat-based interview ‚Äî like a real one!
	3.	Asks 5 smart questions using GPT-4o based on skills you gave.
	4.	Checks if your answers are on point (but doesn‚Äôt explain the answers).
	5.	Saves the entire convo + details to a .json file on Google Cloud Storage.

‚∏ª

How it Works?

1. Libraries Used

import streamlit as st
import openai
import json
from google.cloud import storage
from datetime import datetime
from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials

2. What are we storing?

We are saving:
	‚Ä¢	Name, email, phone etc.
	‚Ä¢	Tech stack like Python, Django, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Interview Q&A logs ‚Äî everything the bot and user say.

‚∏ª

Session Initialization

Before anything happens, we make sure that some variables exist in memory:

if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

	‚Ä¢	messages ‚Üí stores all chatbot and user messages
	‚Ä¢	interview_started, interview_ended ‚Üí to control the flow
	‚Ä¢	All the form details ‚Üí name, email, experience, etc.

‚∏ª

Candidate Info Form

When the user visits the app, if interview not started, it shows a form like this:

st.text_input("Full Name")
st.number_input("Years of Experience")
st.multiselect("Tech Stack")

Once submitted:
	‚Ä¢	If anything is missing ‚Üí shows error.
	‚Ä¢	Else ‚Üí starts the interview!

‚∏ª

System Prompt Setup (For GPT-4)

This is how GPT-4o knows how to behave:

"You are an expert technical interviewer at TalentScout..."

We tell it things like:
	‚Ä¢	Ask only 5 questions.
	‚Ä¢	Stay on topic.
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt tolerate rubbish.
	‚Ä¢	Give feedback (but no long explanations).
	‚Ä¢	Be friendly, but also strict with flow.

‚∏ª

üí¨ Starting the Interview

If the candidate submitted their form:
	‚Ä¢	First question is generated using openai.chat.completions.create().
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs shown using st.chat_message.

st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": q})


‚∏ª

For Each Answer

User types the answer in st.chat_input. Then:
	‚Ä¢	We check if it‚Äôs ‚Äúexit‚Äù, then end early.
	‚Ä¢	Else:
	‚Ä¢	Send updated conversation to GPT.
	‚Ä¢	Get next question.
	‚Ä¢	Show it and update state.

if st.session_state.question_count < 5:
    # keep asking


‚∏ª

After 5 Questions

After 5 rounds:
	‚Ä¢	It says thank you and ends politely.
	‚Ä¢	Shows balloons 
	‚Ä¢	Calls upload_to_gcs() to save everything.

‚∏ª

Google Cloud Logging

What it does:

def upload_to_gcs(bucket_name, data):

	‚Ä¢	Creates a JSON file using current date and time
	‚Ä¢	Uses your GCP service account credentials from st.secrets
	‚Ä¢	Uploads to a bucket like: gs://logs_chatbotbyfaheem/interview_log_20250613_001539.json

‚∏ª

Secrets

OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
[gcp_service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "..."
private_key_id = "..."
private_key = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."
client_email = "..."
